# Dishpatch Frontend Task

## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there

For this task we'd like you to build a simple responsive collection UI. Please use the data provided at the top of `index.tsx` to display your products. Designs can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/9p1gTUp3gtQV322qIfYcZB/Technical-Task?node-id=806%3A3431&t=Xrcs9XxeBXx9LfvF-1).

This task isn't designed to take a huge amount of time (1 - 2 hours max). We're more interested in how you approach the task. It would be great if you could use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). To get started, fork this repository.

Once completed, please send us a link to your repository.

Any questions, please email [jordan@dishpatch.co.uk](mailto:jordan@dishpatch.co.uk)

Good luck! ðŸš€
